# Time_Series_Forecasting_ARIMA-Python
Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA | Inspix BI Solutions

📈 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Inspix BI Solutions’ ability to tackle time series forecasting problems using advanced statistical methods. The goal is to accurately predict hourly bike departures for the BIXI bike-sharing system, showcasing how businesses can leverage time series modeling to improve operations, resource planning, and decision-making.

🚲 Dataset Description

The dataset used is real-world BIXI bike-share trip data for August and September 2019. It includes detailed timestamps of trip start times, which are processed and aggregated into hourly departure counts.

Key aspects:

Source: BIXI bike-sharing data.

Time Period: August–September 2019.

Frequency: Hourly data.

Target Variable: Number of bike departures per hour.

🎯 Project Objectives

Load and preprocess raw trip data into a time series format.

Handle missing timestamps and resample data.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for robust model validation.

Apply ARIMA modeling (using pmdarima's auto_arima) to automate order selection.

Forecast hourly departures and evaluate prediction accuracy.

Visualize trends, autocorrelation, and prediction results.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries:

pandas (data handling)

statsmodels (time series models)

pmdarima (auto ARIMA)

matplotlib (visualization)

numpy

🔍 Project Steps

1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing

Load multiple CSV files containing raw trip records.

Merge and clean data.

Convert timestamps to hourly buckets.

Fill missing hourly values using interpolation.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plot time series.

Generate autocorrelation plots to check stationarity and lag patterns.

3️⃣ Train-Test Split

Reserve the last week for testing (September 29 – October 6, 2019).

Use earlier data for training the ARIMA model.

4️⃣ Model Building

Fit an ARIMA model using pmdarima’s auto_arima to find optimal parameters (p, d, q).

Train the model on the training data.

5️⃣ Forecasting & Evaluation

Forecast the test period.

Compare predicted vs. actual values.

Visualize predictions and errors.

6️⃣ Insights & Business Value

Understand daily and weekly usage patterns.

Generate actionable insights for scheduling, resource allocation, and peak-hour planning.

✅ Key Outcomes

Successfully demonstrated end-to-end time series modeling.

Showcased how ARIMA can automate forecasting for operations.

Provided visual and quantitative validation of the model’s predictions.

Illustrated Inspix BI Solutions’ expertise in turning raw time-stamped data into meaningful forecasts.
